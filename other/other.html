            <p>An apple logo which was eaten from the top right corner. But look! It seems like not eaten. Maybe any CSE student did this with his pen because in this room, CSE students come to class! Feel like, A computer science engineer repaired a large computer related company's a error , an apple which was not in normal shape!</p>

            <p>"Mybe I am in a jungle or not. I can often listen bird's song. These birds are so cute and beautiful and with a very special and with own lifestyle. Because of it no one can see them. They can be so dangerous too. But in jungle or in locality it doesn't matter. A brid can fly everywhere. So maybe it doesn't matter to find these kind of special uncommon birds I have to go to jaungle! Suddenly I listend a this kind of special bird's song today! Though I listened so many this kind of bird's song and nowadays I can listen everyday. But it was new! "</p>
